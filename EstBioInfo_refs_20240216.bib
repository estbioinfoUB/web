@article{PMID:36364950,
	abstract = {The gut microbiome is involved in nutrient metabolism and produces metabolites that, via the gut\&ndash;brain axis, signal to the brain and influence cognition. Human studies have so far had limited success in identifying early metabolic alterations linked to cognitive aging, likely due to limitations in metabolite coverage or follow-ups. Older persons from the Three-City population-based cohort who had not been diagnosed with dementia at the time of blood sampling were included, and repeated measures of cognition over 12 subsequent years were collected. Using a targeted metabolomics platform, we identified 72 circulating gut-derived metabolites in a case\&ndash;control study on cognitive decline, nested within the cohort (discovery n = 418; validation n = 420). Higher serum levels of propionic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, were associated with increased odds of cognitive decline (OR for 1 SD = 1.40 (95\% CI 1.11, 1.75) for discovery and 1.26 (1.02, 1.55) for validation). Additional analyses suggested mediation by hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. Propionic acid strongly correlated with blood glucose (r = 0.79) and with intakes of meat and cheese (r \&gt; 0.15), but not fiber (r = 0.04), suggesting a minor role of prebiotic foods per se, but a possible link to processed foods, in which propionic acid is a common preservative. The adverse impact of propionic acid on metabolism and cognition deserves further investigation.},

	abstract = {The study of biomarkers of dietary patterns including the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is scarce and could improve the assessment of these patterns. Moreover, it could provide a better understanding of health benefits of dietary patterns in nutritional epidemiology. We aimed to determine a robust and accurate biomarker associated with a high adherence to a MedDiet pattern that included dietary assessment and its biological effect. In this cross-sectional study, we included 56 and 63 individuals with high (H-MDA) and low (L-MDA) MedDiet adherence categories, respectively, all from the Prevenci{\'o}n con Dieta Mediterr{\'a}nea trial. A 1H-NMR-based untargeted metabolomics approach was applied to urine samples. Multivariate statistical analyses were conducted to determine the metabolite differences between groups. A stepwise logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to build and evaluate the prediction model for H-MDA. Thirty-four metabolites were identified as discriminant between H-MDA and L-MDA. The fingerprint associated with H-MDA included higher excretion of proline betaine and phenylacetylglutamine, among others, and decreased amounts of metabolites related to glucose metabolism. Three microbial metabolites --- phenylacetylglutamine, p-cresol and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate --- were included in the prediction model of H-MDA (95\% specificity, 95\% sensitivity and 97\% area under the curve). The model composed of microbial metabolites was the biomarker that defined high adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern. The overall metabolite profiling identified reflects the metabolic modulation produced by H-MDA. The proposed biomarker may be a better tool for assessing and aiding nutritional epidemiology in future associations between H-MDA and the prevention or amelioration of chronic diseases.},

	abstract = {A polyphenol-rich diet reduced intestinal permeability (IP) in older adults. Our aim was to evaluate if participants categorized according to urolithin metabotypes (UMs) exhibited different responses in the MaPLE trial. Fifty-one older adults (mean age: 78 years) completed an 8-week randomized-controlled-crossover trial comparing the effects of a polyphenol-rich vs. a control diet on IP, assessed through zonulin levels. Plasma and urinary metabolomics were evaluated with a semi-targeted UHPLC-MS/MS method. Gut microbiota was characterized by 16S rRNA gene profiling. UMs were determined according to urolithin excretion in 24 h urine samples. Multivariate statistics were used to characterize the differences in metabolomic and metataxonomic responses across UMs. Thirty-three participants were classified as urolithin metabotype A (UMA), 13 as urolithin metabotype B (UMB), and 5 as urolithin metabotype 0 (UM0) according to their urinary excretion of urolithins. Clinical, dietary, and biochemical characteristics at baseline were similar between UMs (all p > 0.05). After the polyphenol-rich diet, UMB vs. UMA participants showed a 2-fold higher improvement of zonulin levels (p for interaction = 0.033). Moreover, UMB vs. UMA participants were characterized for alterations in fatty acid metabolism, kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism, and microbial metabolization of phenolic acids. These changes were correlated with the reduction of zonulin levels and modifications of gut microbes (increased Clostridiales, including, R. lactaris, and G. formicilis). In conclusion, urolithin-based metabotyping identified older adults with a higher improvement of IP after a polyphenol-rich diet. Our results reinforce the concept that UMs may contribute to tailor personalized nutrition interventions.},

Image files were downloaded from the pathology contests CAMELYON 16 and 17. We show that widely known architectures, such as: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) and Conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (cDCGAN), allow image editing using semantic concepts that represent underlying visual patterns in histopathological images, expanding GAN's well-known capabilities in medical image editing. We computed the Grad-cam heatmap of real positive images and of generated positive images, validating that the highlighted features both in the real and synthetic images match. We also show that GANs can be used to generate quality images, making GANs a valuable resource for augmenting small medical imaging datasets.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that infants and children have a greater intake per unit of body weight of soil, air and water. The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence and concentrations of potentially toxic metals/metalloids in soils to which children are exposed to during outdoor school activities. A total of 76 soil samples from 38 schoolyards throughout Talcahuano, Chile were collected. For each schoolyard site, a sample of the topsoil (ts, 0 to 10cm) and subsurface soil (ss, 10 to 20cm) was collected for analysis. The processed samples were analyzed by ICP-emission spectrometry following aqua regia digestion for the following elements: As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. The median concentrations (mgkg−1) obtained include: As 6 (range 1--24), Cr 29 (14--253), Cu 40 (11--190), Ni 30 (7--79), Pb 26.5 (3--349), and Zn 172 (29--1865). Different methods were evaluated in order to facilitate the best diagnosis of contamination. First, the trace element geochemical background was determined using basic descriptive statistics. Second, the basic descriptive statistics were then compared with Dutch guidelines, in order to evaluate whether the concentrations measured in soils were abnormally large. By comparing the results of the different methods, we estimate that 34\% of the schoolyards demonstrate contamination.},

	abstract = {In many cases when scientists use hypothesis tests they are fully aware that the statistical model itself, and a fortiori the null hypothesis, is only a partial description of reality, and, from a logical point of view, it is not strictly true. In particular, this applies to black-box models---those most frequently used in statistics. From this point of view it does not seem very reasonable to choose between hypotheses in terms of their probability of error or, even worse, their conditional probabilities of error, since these indexes are too rough to be useful. In this paper a wide range of classical hypothesis testing problems are examined from the point of view of model selection: the acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis of such a problem is considered in terms of the selection of the most appropriate model, when one is nested inside the other. There are several reasons why a (strictly speaking false) model might be developed: it allows us to synthesize data variability, while maintaining a reasonable fit with observed data, and also it facilitates prediction of new phenomena with a certain degree of accuracy. Quite simply, modeling makes reality more readily understandable. In this context, some problems of the classical hypothesis testing approach are discussed and several alternatives are considered, in developing methods, based on statistical estimation theory, for nested-model selection and a wide class of hypothesis testing problems. These methods are applied to various situations and compared with classical techniques. Finally, a number of questions concerning the nature of statistical inference are posed.},

Introducci{\'o}n
La cirug\'{\i}a prot{\'e}sica de mama es un procedimiento de cirug\'{\i}a pl{\'a}stica muy com{\'u}n, cuyo manejo analg{\'e}sico postoperatorio es un reto para el equipo quir{\'u}rgico. El prop{\'o}sito del presente estudio fue validar la eficacia analg{\'e}sica del bloqueo de los nervios pectorales y plano del serrato en mamoplastia de aumento retropectoral.
Pacientes y m{\'e}todos
Se dise{\~n}{\'o} un ensayo cl\'{\i}nico, controlado, aleatorizado, triple ciego, que incluy{\'o} a 30 pacientes intervenidas mediante mamoplastia de aumento retropectoral. En ambos grupos se realizaron bloqueo pectoral modificado y bloqueo del plano serrato con un volumen total de 40ml por mama. En 15 de ellas se inyect{\'o} bupivaca\'{\i}na 0,25\% con epinefrina (GPEC), y en las otras 15 se administr{\'o} suero fisiol{\'o}gico (GC). Se hizo manejo estandarizado de la anestesia y la analgesia postoperatoria. Se midieron par{\'a}metros hemodin{\'a}micos intraoperatorios, necesidad de analgesia postoperatoria y la escala num{\'e}rica verbal a su llegada a reanimaci{\'o}n, a las 3, 6 y 24h, as\'{\i} como la calidad percibida por los pacientes y cirujanos.
Resultados
En el postoperatorio inmediato, se pudo percibir una disminuci{\'o}n del dolor en las pacientes del GPEC (5,3±2,3 vs. 2,9±2,7; p=0,018). No se observaron diferencias significativas a las 3, 6 y 24h. Los cirujanos valoraron la calidad anest{\'e}sico-analg{\'e}sica como muy buena en el 80\% de los casos en el GPEC frente al 33\% en el GC (p=0,01).
Conclusiones
El uso de estos bloqueos es una buena estrategia analg{\'e}sica perioperatoria en el manejo multimodal en la mamoplastia de aumento retropectoral.
Introduction
Prosthetic breast surgery is a very common plastic surgery procedure, but its postoperative analgesic management is a challenge for the surgical team. The purpose of the present study is to validate the analgesic efficacy of pectoral block and serratus plane block in retropectoral mammoplasty.
Patients and methods
A randomised, controlled, triple-blind, clinical trial was designed, and included 30 patients undergoing retropectoral augmentation mammoplasty. All of them had a modified PECII block and a serratus plane block with a total volume of 40ml per breast. In 15 of them bupivacaine 0.25\% (GPEC) was injected and in the other 15 patients saline was used (GC). Standardised management of anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia was performed. Intra-operative haemodynamic parameters required for postoperative analgesia, and a numeric verbal scale on arrival in the recovery unit were measured and at 3, 6, and 24h. The quality perceived by patients and surgeons was also measured.
Results
Post-operative pain was significantly better in GPEC (5.3±2.3 vs. 2.9±2.7; P=.018). No significant differences were observed at 3, 6, and 24h. The surgeons rated the anaesthetic-analgesic quality as very good in 80\% of the cases in GPEC versus 33\% in CG (P=.01).
Conclusions
The use of these blocks is a good perioperative analgesic strategy in the multimodal management of retropectoral augmentation mammoplasty.},
